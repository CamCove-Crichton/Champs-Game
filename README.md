# Champs

## A numbers guessing game, where the player has to enter a number in combination with a generated number from the computer to reach the same number displayed as the target number

### How to play:
- The player must try to match the target number by entering a number
- The computer will also generate a number once the player has put their number in
- If the sum of the players number and the computers number matches the target number, the player gets a point, if not then the computer gets a point
